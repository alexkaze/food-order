# Food Order

## About

> **Note**
> Food Order is a simple project without any practical use. My aim was to learn React.js.

This is a simple app for ordering food. [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/) is integrated with the app for more natural imitation of order making.  
There are only 4 items to choose. A user is able to make an order. It will be sent to the Firebase Realtime Database.
