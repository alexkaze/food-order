# Food Order App

> **Note**
> This is a training project to improve my skills in react app development.

---

This is a simple app for ordering food. [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/) is integrated with the app for more natural imitation of order making.  
There are only 4 items to choose. A user is able to make an order. It will be sent to the Firebase Realtime Database.

You can try https://food-ord.netlify.app

> **Note**  
> The app is not adapted for the mobile version

### The following stack is used:

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS (`[name].module.scss`)
- JavaScript
- ReactJS + React Context
- Webpack 5

> **Note**  
> It is not the project created with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) way. It is built and configured with Webpack from scratch.
